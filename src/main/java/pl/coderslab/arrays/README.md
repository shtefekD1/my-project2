## Exercise 1 - done with the lecturer

In the `Main01.java` file:

1. create a 50-element array called `mainTab` with consecutive integers from 0 to 49,
2. write the elements of this array one by one on the console, ten in each line,
3. complete the single-digit numbers with an additional zero at the beginning (e.g. 03).

```
00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29,
30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39,
40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49,
```


## Exercise 2

In the `Main02.java` file:

1. using the `for` loop, create an array called `randNumbers` containing 20 random numbers from the range `0-100` (use the method described in the snippets to obtain a random value),
3. write the minimum value from the array in the console.


## Exercise 3

In the `Main03.java` file:

1. create a 10-element array filled with a single value: "2". The array should look like this:
    ````
    [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
    ````
2. do the exercise **without using the `for` loop**.


## Exercise 4

In the `Main04.java` file:

1. create an array called `numbers` containing any 10 numbers,
2. create an array variable `reverse` and place elements of the `numbers` array in it in reverse order,
3. write the elements of the `reverse` array on the console.

For an array with the following elements:
```
3, 5, 7, 2, 1
```
you will get:
```
1, 2, 7, 5, 3
```


## Exercise 5

In the `Main05.java` file:

1. create an array called `numbers` containing any 10 numbers,
2. sort the array in ascending order using methods of the `Arrays` class,
3. display a sorted array in the console - also using a method from the `Arrays` class.


## Exercise 6

In the `Main06.java` file:

1. create an array called `numbers` containing any 10 numbers,
2. create a second array, name it `secondNumbers`, fill in any 10 numbers,
3. create a third array containing the sum of the elements that have a position in the first two arrays with the same index.

For example:
```java
int[] numbers = {2, 3};
int[] secondNumbers = {3, 4};
```
the result will be an array with elements `5` and `7`.
