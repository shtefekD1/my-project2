## Exercise 1 - done with the lecturer

The `Main01` file contains code of a program.

1. Set the breakpoint at the instruction `int x = 33 * 55;` and then run the program in debug mode.
2. Take a step forward and see the variable `x`.
3. Take a step forward and see the `text` variable again.
4. Take a step forward and go to the `bar` method from the `Foo` class using the `Step into` button.
5. Return to the `main` method of the class `Main01` using the `Step out` button.
6. Run the program until the end using the `Resume` button.


## Exercise 2 - done with the lecturer

The `Main02` file contains the code of a program.

1. Set the breakpoint at the expression `int a = 11 / 3;` and then run the program in debug mode.
2. Take steps forward until the end, checking the values that the variables take.


## Exercise 3

The `Main03` file contains the code of a program.

1. Set a breakpoint in the line:
````
 b = i < 9995 ? a / i : a * i;
````
and run the program in debug mode.
1. Run the program several times and then stop it.
2. Modify the breakpoint by giving it the condition `i<3`.
3. Debug the program again and again, until the exception occurs. 
4. Leave the program with the error.


## Exercise 4

The `Main04` file contains a method for calculating the sum of elements passed as an argument.
1. Debug and then fix the program so that it returns the correct result.


## Exercise 5

The `Main05` file contains a method for calculating the arithmetic mean of the elements passed as an argument.
1. Debug and fix the program so that it returns the correct result.
